# 💡 Lab 2.5: LED Circuit with Transistors and Capacitors#
*This lab demonstrates a basic LED circuit using NPN transistors, capacitors, and resistors to create a simple blinking or alternating LED effect. It's a classic beginner-friendly project to learn about transistor switching and timing behavior with passive components.*
## ⚙️ Circuit Description
This circuit uses capacitor charging/discharging and transistor switching to alternately blink two LEDs. The setup behaves like a simple astable multivibrator, generating a square wave without needing a microcontroller.

Each transistor drives one LED and is triggered by the capacitor connected to the opposite side. The resistor values and capacitor sizes determine the blink rate.
