#ðŸ’¡ Lab 2.5: LED Circuit with Transistors and Capacitors#
*This lab demonstrates a basic LED circuit using NPN transistors, capacitors, and resistors to create a simple blinking or alternating LED effect. It's a classic beginner-friendly project to learn about transistor switching and timing behavior with passive components.*
