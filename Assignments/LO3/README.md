# Lab 3: PCB Lab â€“ Sonic LED Level Meter
*This lab guides you through constructing a Sonic LED Level Meter using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LEDs mounted on a PCB (or breadboard), and Arduino coding. You'll solder components to build a responsive level meterâ€”with readings illuminated by LEDs based on measured distance.*

## Project Overview
The ultrasonic sensor scans distances and interprets them to light up a series of LEDsâ€”mimicking a level meter display. Soldered components on a PCB make for a more permanent and robust version compared to breadboard prototypes.
