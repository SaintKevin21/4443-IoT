# Lab 3: PCB Lab â€“ Sonic LED Level Meter
*This lab guides you through constructing a Sonic LED Level Meter using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LEDs mounted on a PCB (or breadboard), and Arduino coding. You'll solder components to build a responsive level meterâ€”with readings illuminated by LEDs based on measured distance.*

## Project Overview
The ultrasonic sensor scans distances and interprets them to light up a series of LEDsâ€”mimicking a level meter display. Soldered components on a PCB make for a more permanent and robust version compared to breadboard prototypes.

# Notes & Tips
## PCB Assembly:##
Follow the included diagrams or photos for accurate LED placement and soldering orientation.

HC-SR04 Wiring:

VCC â†’ 5 V

GND â†’ GND

TRIG â†’ Digital pin X

ECHO â†’ Digital pin Y

## Soldering Best Practices:

Use proper temperature control to avoid overheating components.

Ensure clean, soldered joints for reliable operation.

Test the circuit on a breadboard before final PCB committing.

## Adjustments:##
Tweak thresholds or distance ranges in the Arduino code to change LED lighting behavior.
