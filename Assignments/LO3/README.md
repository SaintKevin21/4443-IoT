# Lab 3: PCB Lab – Sonic LED Level Meter
*This lab guides you through constructing a Sonic LED Level Meter using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, LEDs mounted on a PCB (or breadboard), and Arduino coding. You'll solder components to build a responsive level meter—with readings illuminated by LEDs based on measured distance.*
