# 🏁 Personal Project: Ready Set Go!
*This project combines an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and an LCD display to create a "Ready–Set–Go" style system. The ultrasonic sensor detects when an object is in position, the LCD displays countdown messages, and the servo can be triggered to start a mechanism once the countdown ends.*

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Object Detection – The HC-SR04 detects an object within a set range.

2. Countdown Display – The LCD shows “Ready”, “Set”, and “Go” in sequence.

3. Servo Activation – When “Go” is displayed, the servo moves to trigger your start mechanism (e.g., opening a gate, starting a timer, etc.).
