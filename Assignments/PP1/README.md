# 📡 Personal Project: Arduino Radar Sensor
*This project uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to create a simple radar system. The Arduino controls the servo to scan an area while the ultrasonic sensor measures distances. Data is sent to the Processing IDE for a real-time graphical display, simulating a radar sweep.*

## #⚙️ How It Works
Servo Control – The Arduino sweeps the servo motor back and forth.

Distance Measurement – At each angle, the HC-SR04 measures the distance to an object.

Data Transfer – The Arduino sends angle and distance values over serial to the computer.

Radar Visualization – The Processing IDE reads the data and displays it as a radar-like scanning animation.
