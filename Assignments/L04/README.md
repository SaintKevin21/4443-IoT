# ‚õ≥ Arduino Mini Golf Game ‚Äì 3D Printed
*This project combines Arduino electronics with 3D printing to create a playable miniature golf game. It includes a fully 3D-printed golf course, controller case, clubs, and balls‚Äîalong with an Arduino-powered control system using a servo motor and joystick for interactive gameplay.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
### 3D Printed Course 
*The golf course is designed to fit small printed balls and clubs.*

### Controller with Joystick 
*A custom 3D-printed case houses a joystick for controlling the swing.*

### Servo Motor Swing 
*The joystick input controls the servo's position and swing speed, simulating putting strength.*

### Play & Score 
*Aim, adjust swing power, and try to get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible.*

##üìù Notes
Printing Tips: Use PLA or PETG for durability; 0.2mm layer height recommended.

Servo Mounting: Secure with screws or glue inside the printed controller case.

Joystick Wiring:

VCC ‚Üí 5V

GND ‚Üí GND

VRx ‚Üí Analog pin A0

Modify the Arduino code to change swing speed, range, or joystick sensitivity.
